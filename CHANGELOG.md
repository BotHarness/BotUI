## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- **`dot-matrix`** — a loading field as five replaceable layers: lattice/silhouette,
  traversal order, brightness envelope, dot polygon, renderer. Two renderers (SVG
  per-frame, CSS `@keyframes` at zero JS per frame) driven by one `field(options, t)`,
  so they cannot disagree.
- **`dot-matrix-react`** — the `<DotMatrix>` wrapper, with `state="thinking"` mapping an
  agent state to a motion.
- A shadcn-compatible registry at `https://ui.botharness.ai`, so
  `npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.botharness.ai/r/dot-matrix.json` installs the same
  components as `npx @botharness/botui add dot-matrix`.
- `@botharness/botui` — the installer, with `add` / `list` / `info`, `--dry-run`,
  `--force` and conflict reporting.
- A docs site on `ui.botharness.ai` running the built engine, not a copy of it.
